# Johennie Helton

**Independent researcher and technologist working at the intersection of AI, copyright, and narrative.**

My background spans 30 years in industry and academia, from early hypermedia systems to present-day AI and digital humanities.  
I hold an M.S. in Computer Science (University of Colorado Boulder).  

### Current Research
I am the author of the **Narrative Flattening Analysis Framework (NFAF)**, a methodological framework for analyzing how AI-mediated processes (translation, summarization, rewriting) transform meaning and narrative voice.
